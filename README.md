# Developer Overview     ## *page under construction* ##
Check out a small handful of applications that I have built during my time as an iOS Engineer.<br/>


## Care Corp Communities - V2


<a href="https://github.com/garymansted/CareCorpCommunities-V2_APP"><img src="/assets/CCC_Image_V2_1.png" width="225" height="400" title="Care Corp Communities - Residents Help App"></a>

**CareCorp Communities** is an Owners Corporation Business based in Melbourne, Australia who specialise in elite management services.<br/>
The CareCorp Communities app conveys relevant and important information to its community members (residents). This, the *second version* also allows community members, along with potential new clients, the ability to directly contact the various persons who are responsible for all building related enquiries.<br/>
The CCC app utilises the iOS auto layout feature, along with frame based layouts, to dynamically scale and constrain the UI for all iOS devices currently availble.<br/> 

```
Frameworks used in V2 include:
UIKit

## Care Corp Communities - V1
The *first version* of the CCCommunities application allowed community members to book the recreational facilities in their building and make appointments with their Building Manager. See below.

## MUMR
MUMR - Make Up My Room was built as a proof of concept IoT application to allow hotel guests the ability to let staff know if they wanted a room makeup, room service or to be left alone - doing away with the token Do-Not-Disturb door hanger sign.

**JuiceBox** was the first (2016) fuel price finder *real-time* application released in NSW Australia. 
Built using scraping techniques (xpath drilling) to scrape relevant data from the centralised fuel price server. Users have the ability to search by fuel type along with a distance. Leveraging applicaition deep-linking, JuiceBox also provides directions to the user selected service station, connecting them with the native navigation app - for a seemless experience.<br/> <br/>

</p>

**Circles** was a small app written in Swift 4 for a coding challenge recently updated to Swift 5.<br/>
##### Release Notes/ Brief:<br/>
- Deployment target: iOS 11.0 +<br/>
- A user can spawn an infinite number of circles by tapping on the main view. 
- The newly created circle animates by scaling it's size. 
- The circles sizes are calculated randomly between 40 - 100 px. 
- The circles are filled with random colors that are obtained by a http request from: www.colourlovers.com/api/colors/random?format=json. If there is no network connection available or the request fails a random color is generated in code. A user can double tap a circle to change its color - color obtained by the above mentioned random color generator. 
- A user can move a circle around the view by tap and dragging it. 
- A user can pinch zoom to enlarge or shrink a circle. 
- A user can skake the divice to remove all circles in the view.<br/>

## BlueSky

    <img src="/assets/BlueSky_Image_11.png" width="169" height="365" title="BlueSky - Coding Challenge App">
</p>

**BlueSky** was a small app initially build in Swift 4 for demonstrating my iOS native app building skills, ability to write clean and maintainable code along with testing out my attention to detail. *Updated to Swift 5*<br/>
The brief is outlined below:
##### Requirements:
- Use a UITableViewController to display weather information of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane as start.
- Provide a way to add more cities using another modal view controller which includes a search functionality to find a city by name or location.
- City IDs - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are: 4163971, 2147714, 2174003 
- Each cell should display at least two pieces of info: Name of city on the left, temperature on the right.
- Weather should be automatically updated periodically.
- Use Storyboard and Autolayouts.
- It is fine to use 3rd party libraries via CocoaPods or by other means.
##### Brownie Points:
- Use an activity indicator to provide some feedback to user while waiting for network response.
- Allow user to tap on a cell to open a new “Detail view”, to show more information about the city such as current weather summary, min and max temperature, humidity, etc.
- Try to use table view or collection view to display details.
- In the “Detail view”, implement animations to enhance the user experience.
- Support all different dimensions of the devices.
- Support landscape and portrait view together<br/><br/>

## CyberStudios


<a href="https://github.com/garymansted/CyberStudios_APP"><img src="/assets/CyberStudios_App_Icon.png" width="240" height="240" title="CyberStudios - IoT Device Registry App"></a>


<p align="left">
    <img src="/assets/CyberStudiosDemo.gif" width="225" height="451" title="CyberStudios - IoT Device Registry & Control App">
</p>

**CyberStudios** was initally created for the registration and control of custom IoT devices. The IoT devices were capable of real-time, two-way data transmission via WiFi or celular connection. Firstly the device is registered (added to the users account), assigned to one of the formention connections and given a name for quick reference. Once registered the user could control their devices' via the main interface - switching on and off, setting device pararameters (delays ect) along with monitoring incomming data.<br/>
The app was tested by staff and clients within the hotel industry. Clients were able to set certain alerts that alerted service staff to their requirements/ needs - greatly reducing service times and daily opperation running costs. Staff recevied remote (push) notifications for their communication efficiency. The alerts included a *'Make up my Room'* alert, a *'Do Not Disturb'* alert, and a *''* alert. Service staff were able to dismiss the notifications (alerts) on the device itself - sending requests to the main server that were received by the account holder.<br/><br/>
The app was beta tested through [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/) to make sure it was bug free before release.

</p>

**Ping** was the brain child of good friend [Bennet Dalton](https://au.linkedin.com/in/bennet-dalton-myi). First released (seven years ago) as a way to find your friends when your 'out and about' and wanting to connect. Users would send and receive *'Pings'* asking for location, responding to location requests along with augmented navigation support. These requests were performed in the background via remote (push) notifications. After a couple of successful years in the market Apple released their own version called 'Find My Friends' - which was a defining pivot point towards what it is now: [Foodie-curated cafes, restaurants and bars.](https://www.pingmethen.com/) App blurb: Peruse curated maps from our favourite foodies by Vegan, Burgers, Rooftops. Get the latest in Speciality Coffee, cafe openings, new eateries.

</p>


Brewski was an app written in SWIFT 5 that targeting the latest iOS version -> 13.2. It was built for a coding task.br/>
The brief is outlined below:
##### Project Requirements:
- Using the BreweryDB API, create an iOS application to list beers from the API.
- The web application should be written in Swift using Xcode, targeting the latest version of the iOS SDK (13).
- API docs: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs ~ has since been retired
- Sandbox URL: https://sandbox-api.brewerydb.com/v2/
- Sandbox API key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- The user should be able to search the list of beers and see a paged list.
- The user should be able to click on the beer for more information.
To show a bit of flare I added a device shake gesture that spawned extra beer bubbles that slowly dissapated - resembelling a real beer!
